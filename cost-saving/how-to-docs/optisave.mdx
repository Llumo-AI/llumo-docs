## Core Objectives of OptiSave:

OptiSave is designed to address several key challenges faced by businesses when interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs). Its core objectives focus on optimizing AI model interactions by improving efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing the overall quality of generated outputs. Below is a detailed breakdown of each core objective:

### 1. Upto 80% Cost Reduction:

One of the primary objectives of OptiSave is to compress input prompt usage while retaining the full meaning of the original input prompt. In the context of LLMs, a "token" represents a unit of text, and the more tokens an input contains, the greater the computational resources required to process it. Tokenization can increase the cost of API usage and may lead to slower processing times if the inputs are too large.

API costs for using LLMs are often directly tied to the number of tokens sent to and generated by the model. Since large inputs and long outputs can quickly add up in terms of cost, minimizing token usage is a significant concern for businesses operating on a budget.

#### How Cost Reduction Works:

OptiSave employs advanced techniques like Token reduction, cache management and quality management to compress the input prompt. This involves identifying and eliminating redundant words, phrases, or parts of the input that do not contribute significantly to the model’s understanding.

#### How LLUMO AI Optimizes Tokens & Saves Costs at Scale

**What is a Token & How is it Calculated?**

A token is a unit of text processed by a language model. It can be a word, a part of a word, or even a punctuation mark.

LLMs charge based on the number of tokens used per query, meaning longer prompts = higher costs. Optimizing token usage can drastically reduce your expenses.

#### Example

**Without OptiSave**  
Query: "Provide a comprehensive report on the impact of artificial intelligence across industries, including automation trends, economic changes, workforce adaptation, regulatory challenges, and ethical considerations. Also, include case studies, expert opinions, and predictions for the next decade."  
Context: “Knowledgebase”  
Input Tokens = Tokens in “Query” + “Context”  
Assuming Input Tokens = 2,000  

**With OptiSave**  
Precise Query: "Summarize AI’s impact on industries, including automation, economy, workforce, regulations, and ethics."  
Precise Context: “Knowledgebase”  
Input Tokens = Tokens in “Precise Query” + “Precise Context”  
Input Tokens using OptiSave = 873 tokens.

#### Token Reduction & Cost Savings

- 2,000 tokens → 873 tokens (56.35% reduction)  
- Assumed cost per token: $0.0001  

**Without Optisave:**  
2,000 tokens × $0.0001 = $0.20 per query  

**With Optisave:**  
873×0.0001=$0.0873 per query  

**Total Cost Savings Per Query:**  
0.20−0.0873=$0.1127 per query (56.35% reduction)  

**Impact at scale**  
If running 500,000 queries per month:  
- Without Optisave:  
    500,000×0.20=$100,000 per month  
- With OptiSave:  
    500,000×0.0873=$43,650 per month  

**Total Monthly Savings:**  
100,000−43,650=$56,350 saved per month  
**Annual Savings:**  
56,350×12=$676,200 saved per year

### 2. Improved Latency:

Response time is a critical factor for many real-time AI applications. High latency can be frustrating for users and can impact the overall user experience, especially in interactive environments like chatbots or customer support systems. Reducing the time it takes for an AI model to generate a response is crucial for improving performance.

#### How Latency Optimization Works:

OptiSave addresses latency by reducing computational overhead. By compressing inputs and eliminating unnecessary complexity, OptiSave allows the model to process requests faster. Furthermore, the tool intelligently refines input prompts to ensure that the model’s response generation process is as streamlined as possible, minimizing the time required to generate a high-quality output.

### 3. Reduce Hallucinations:

Hallucinations refer to instances when AI models generate responses that are misleading, inaccurate, or completely false. These errors can be particularly problematic in domains where precision and reliability are critical. Minimizing hallucinations is essential to ensure the trustworthiness and quality of the generated outputs.

#### How to reduce Hallucinations:

OptiSave tackles hallucinations by improving the clarity and precision of input prompts. Through advanced prompt engineering, it ensures that the model receives clear, concise, and well-structured input. This clarity reduces the likelihood of misinterpretation by the model, which is one of the common causes of hallucinations. Additionally, OptiSave may incorporate mechanisms to provide models with more specific context or grounding information, thereby reducing ambiguity and improving the accuracy of responses.
