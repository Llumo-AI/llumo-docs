### Step 2: Go to Prompt

Here, you can follow these steps:

1. **Write Prompt:** Enter your prompt by providing the desired query or instruction to guide the AI model in generating the results you expect.

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="https://storage.googleapis.com/llumo-blog-images-1/03-01-25/Custom-Eval-Metrics-6.webp"
/>
2. **Create a Smart Prompt:** Refines your written prompt, making it more specific and detailed to generate more accurate and focused results.

  src="https://storage.googleapis.com/llumo-blog-images-1/03-01-25/Custom-Eval-Metrics-7.webp"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="https://storage.googleapis.com/llumo-blog-images-1/03-01-25/Custom-Eval-Metrics-7.webp"
/>
3. **Select Your LLM Provider:** Choose your preferred provider from the drop-down list (LLUMO supports multiple LLM providers).
4. **Choose the Model:** Select the specific AI model you want to use for generating the results, based on your needs.
5. **Adjust Parameters:** Fine-tune the model’s parameters to match your requirements and improve output precision.

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="https://storage.googleapis.com/llumo-blog-images-1/03-01-25/Custom-Eval-Metrics-8.webp"
/>
6. **Select Output Type:** Choose the type of output you want for the generated results.

### Step 3: Run the Prompts to Generate Outputs

1. Once the dataset is uploaded, initiate the process to run the prompts and generate outputs.
2. Allow the system to complete processing your prompts.
3. Once the outputs are ready, proceed to the evaluation step.

Here, you can observe the prompt running to generate the output. Once the output is generated, the evaluation process will begin.

### Step 4: Custom Evaluation

1. Go to the "Create Column" section.

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="https://storage.googleapis.com/llumo-blog-images-1/03-01-25/Custom-Eval-Metrics-9.webp"
/>
2. Select the "Custom Evaluation" option.

/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="https://storage.googleapis.com/llumo-blog-images-1/03-01-25/Custom-Eval-Metrics-10.webp"
/>

3. Here, you can create custom evaluation metrics by specifying a column name, defining the evaluation criteria, and selecting the prompt or output to assess. You can also create multiple custom evaluation metrics to evaluate different aspects of your data.

/>
4. Once you've entered all the details, it will appear like this. In this example, I've created a custom metric called **Customer Intent Alignment (CIAS).**
**Definition:** CIAS measures how well the company's response aligns with the customer's intended goal or request, based on AI-driven analysis of both the customer's inquiry and the company's response.

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="https://storage.googleapis.com/llumo-blog-images-1/03-01-25/Custom-Eval-Metrics-12.webp"
/>
5. Select your evaluation model and choose the output column in your dataset that you want to assess. You can experiment with different models and run evaluations on the same prompt to compare their performance, using your custom evaluation metrics to analyze the results.

### Step 5: Evaluation Parameters

**Set Rule for KPIs:**
Each KPI allows you to set a specific threshold to define a "pass" or "fail."

**Example:** For confidence, if the confidence score is more than 50, it passes.

### Step 6: Run the Evaluation

1. **Start the Evaluation:** After confirming your settings, click the "Create and Run All Columns" button to begin processing your evaluation.

  src="https://storage.googleapis.com/llumo-blog-images-1/03-01-25/Custom-Eval-Metrics-13.webp"
/>
2. **Review Evaluation Results:** The evaluation will return detailed results, including Pass/Fail status for each KPI along with percentage scores.

Similarly, we can define multiple custom evaluations to evaluate the output.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**How do I choose the right KPIs for my evaluation?**
Select KPIs based on your evaluation goals. For example, for customer service data, KPIs like Sentiment Analysis and Response Time are essential. For academic writing, Grammar Quality and Clarity may be more relevant.

**What happens if my outputs don’t meet the thresholds I set?**
If an output fails to meet a threshold, it will be flagged as a failure. You can review the failed outputs and adjust the thresholds or improve the outputs to meet the required standards.

**Can I export the evaluation results?**
Yes, once the evaluation is complete, you can export the results in CSV, Excel, or PDF format for further analysis or reporting.

**How long does the evaluation process take?**
The time taken for the evaluation depends on the size of your dataset and the complexity of the model you’ve chosen. Typically, an evaluation of 100 prompts and outputs should take just a few minutes.
