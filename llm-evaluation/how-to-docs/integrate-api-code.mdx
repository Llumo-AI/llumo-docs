/>

Example Header:

```python
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <your-token>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

#### Request Body Format

The request body is a JSON object where you provide essential parameters like your `workspaceID`, the `prompt`, `input`, and `output`.

Example of default evaluation request:

```python
data = {
    "prompt": "I am planning a trip to {{location}}, give me a travel plan",
    "input": {
        "location": "Germany"
    },
    "output": "Absolutely, Germany is a wonderful destination with a rich history, diverse culture, and beautiful landscapes. Here's a suggested travel plan for a memorable trip: Day 1-3: Berlin Day 1: Arrive in Berlin, check into your accommodation, and get acquainted with the city. Visit iconic landmarks such as the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag Building, and Checkpoint Charlie. Day 2: Explore Berlin's cultural scene. Visit Museum Island, home to several world-renowned museums including the Pergamon Museum and the Altes Museum. Take a stroll along the East Side Gallery to see remnants of the Berlin Wall adorned with street art. Day 3: Dive deeper into Berlin's history with a visit to the Holocaust Memorial and the Topography of Terror museum. Spend the evening exploring the vibrant nightlife of neighborhoods like Kreuzberg or Friedrichshain."
}
```

**Explanation of fields:**
- `prompt`: Text or question you want to analyze.
- `input`: Language or other settings (currently only language is supported).
- `output`: The result or analysis based on your input prompt.

### Step 4: Making the API Call

Use the `requests.post()` method to send your data to the API. Below is a sample code that demonstrates how to make the request.

Example Code:

```python
import requests

# URL and headers
url = "https://app.llumo.ai/api/create-eval-analytics"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <your-token>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Request body
data = {
    "prompt": "I am planning a trip to {{location}}, give me a travel plan",
    "input": {
        "location": "Germany"
    },
    "output": "Absolutely, Germany is a wonderful destination with a rich history, diverse culture, and beautiful landscapes. Here's a suggested travel plan for a memorable trip: Day 1-3: Berlin Day 1: Arrive in Berlin, check into your accommodation, and get acquainted with the city. Visit iconic landmarks such as the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag Building, and Checkpoint Charlie. Day 2: Explore Berlin's cultural scene. Visit Museum Island, home to several world-renowned museums including the Pergamon Museum and the Altes Museum. Take a stroll along the East Side Gallery to see remnants of the Berlin Wall adorned with street art. Day 3: Dive deeper into Berlin's history with a visit to the Holocaust Memorial and the Topography of Terror museum. Spend the evening exploring the vibrant nightlife of neighborhoods like Kreuzberg or Friedrichshain.",
}

# Make the POST request
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

# Output the response
print("Status Code:", response.status_code)
print("Response:", response.json())
```

### Default Evaluation Metrics

Upon making a request to the LLUMO AI API, the response will include the following default evaluation metrics:
- **Confidence:** Measures the confidence level of the generated output.
- **Clarity:** Assesses the clarity of the generated text.
- **Context:** Analyzes whether the output aligns with the context provided in the prompt.
- **Overall Score:** A combined score based on the above metrics.

Example Response:

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "metrics": {
        "confidence": 0.92,
        "clarity": 0.85,
        "context": 0.88,
        "overallScore": 0.87
    }
}
```

### Custom Evaluation Metrics

If you want to evaluate your data based on custom-defined analytics in your workspace, you can add a custom analytics name to the request body.

#### Adding Custom Analytics

To specify custom analytics, include the `"analytics"` field in the request body with an array of your custom analytics names.

Example:

```python
data = {
    "prompt": "I am planning a trip to {{location}}, give me a travel plan",
    "input": {
        "location": "Germany"
    },
    "output": "Absolutely, Germany is a wonderful destination with a rich history, diverse culture, and beautiful landscapes. Here's a suggested travel plan for a memorable trip: Day 1-3: Berlin Day 1: Arrive in Berlin, check into your accommodation, and get acquainted with the city. Visit iconic landmarks such as the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag Building, and Checkpoint Charlie. Day 2: Explore Berlin's cultural scene. Visit Museum Island, home to several world-renowned museums including the Pergamon Museum and the Altes Museum. Take a stroll along the East Side Gallery to see remnants of the Berlin Wall adorned with street art. Day 3: Dive deeper into Berlin's history with a visit to the Holocaust Memorial and the Topography of Terror museum. Spend the evening exploring the vibrant nightlife of neighborhoods like Kreuzberg or Friedrichshain.",
    "analytics": ["Perplexity"]  # Custom analytics
}
```

In this case, `"Perplexity"` is a custom analytics name that you have set up in your workspace.

#### Custom Analytics Configuration

Before using custom analytics, ensure they are set up within your workspace on the LLUMO platform. If the analytics name is valid and configured, the API will return metrics for your custom analysis. You can refer to the guide on setting up custom analytics in the Custom Eval Playground [here](#).

Example of Full API Call with Custom Analytics:

```python
import requests

# URL and headers
url = "https://app.llumo.ai/api/create-eval-analytics"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <your-token>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Request body with custom analytics
data = {
    "prompt": "I am planning a trip to {{location}}, give me a travel plan",
    "input": {
        "location": "Germany"
    },
    "output": "Absolutely, Germany is a wonderful destination with a rich history, diverse culture, and beautiful landscapes. Here's a suggested travel plan for a memorable trip: Day 1-3: Berlin Day 1: Arrive in Berlin, check into your accommodation, and get acquainted with the city. Visit iconic landmarks such as the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag Building, and Checkpoint Charlie. Day 2: Explore Berlin's cultural scene. Visit Museum Island, home to several world-renowned museums including the Pergamon Museum and the Altes Museum. Take a stroll along the East Side Gallery to see remnants of the Berlin Wall adorned with street art. Day 3: Dive deeper into Berlin's history with a visit to the Holocaust Memorial and the Topography of Terror museum. Spend the evening exploring the vibrant nightlife of neighborhoods like Kreuzberg or Friedrichshain.",
    "analytics": ["Perplexity"]  # Custom analytics
}

# Make the POST request
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

# Output the response
print("Status Code:", response.status_code)
print("Response:", response.json())
```

#### Sample Response for Custom Analytics

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "analyticsScore": {
        "Perplexity": 0.89,
        "confidence": 0.91,
        "clarity": 0.87,
        "context": 0.84,
