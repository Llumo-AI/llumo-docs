    Click on "Connect Now" and it will open the API connection detail modal

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="copy" title="Copy API endpoint and API key">
  
    * API endpoint: The URL you will use to send requests to the Evaluation API.
    * API key: Your unique API key, which is required for authentication. You will be given one API key by default. But, if you want to create multiple API keys, refer to [managing your keys](https://docs.llumo.ai).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="plus" title="Add sample code in your editor">

    Examples of codes containing request bodies in different languages is provided, that you can use to send a request to the Evaluation API. Copy the sample code block and paste into editor of your choice.
    Below is an example of sample code block in python.

    ```python compressPrompt.py

        import requests

        url = "https://app.llumo.ai/api/create-eval-analytics"

        payload = {
          "prompt": "<string>",
          "prompt": "<string>",
          "input": "<List of inputs used in prompt>",
          output: "<string>",
          analytics: "<List of analytics>",
