## Getting Started with Prompt Compression API

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on setting up prompt compression API, that compresses input prompts before passing it to LLMs, helping you save cost and reduce inference speed.

### 1. Open compressor setup modal

The "Compressor setup modal" provides your essential connection details: API endpoint, key, and sample request bodies. This ensures a smooth setup for compressing your prompts.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user" title="Login and get access">

    If you've already done demo call and got the access to the LLUMO app, this step is complete.

    If you are a new user for [LLUMO AI](https://www.llumo.ai), please refer to [Create Account](https://docs.llumo.ai/setup-llumo/create-account) and [Activate your account](https://docs.llumo.ai/setup-llumo/activate-account)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="arrow-pointer" title="Select cost saving journey">
  
    After you have access and you login to LLUMO for the first time, you will see a modal asking you to select the journey - Cost saving and Evaluation. You need to select the Cost Saving option.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="bars" title="Navigate to Compressor and open setup modal">
  
    If you have already selected the Evaluation option, no worries. If you see the left navigation bar, you will see the compressor option.

  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Setting up Your Editing Environment">
  
    **Edit Locally (Recommended for Developers):**

    1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
    2. Once git is installed, clone your docs repository using `git clone <your-repo>`. If you haven't set it up yet, now would be a good time to do so with these [SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
    3. Use your favorite IDE to open the repository.
    4. Install our Mintlify CLI to preview changes with `npm i -g mintlify`. Learn more about this in our [development guide](/development).

    **Editing Online:**

    Here are two ways to edit your repository online:

    * To edit a single file, locate and click the edit button. This will open a web editor right on Github.
      ![Edit Online](https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/edit-online.png)
    * For a more versatile online experience, open your git repository in Github's [github.dev](https://github.dev) online IDE. Simply replace `github.com` in your repo URL with `github.dev`. For example, use `github.dev/mintlify/docs` instead of `github.com/mintlify/docs`.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="palette" title="Customizing Your Brand (mint.json)">
  
    Easily customize colors, logos and buttons among other configurations in our `mint.json` file. Start with these basic configurations:

    description: "Subtitle (optional)"
    ---

### 3. Supercharging Your Docs

Mintlify supports an array of advanced features like API reference docs, analytics, and versioning to accommodate any of your documentation needs.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Generating API References">

    You can easily set up your API references using an OpenAPI document.

    1. Add your `openapi.yaml` or `openapi.json` file into your docs repository or define the `openapi` field in `mint.json` with a URL.

    ```json
    "openapi": "link-to-your-openapi-file"
    ```

    2. Use our [scraper](/api-playground/openapi/setup#autogenerate-files-recommended) to autogenerate your OpenAPI endpoints files as:

    ```bash
    npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-or-url-to-openapi-file>
    ```

    3. Finally, include the generated endpoint MDX files to your `mint.json` under `navigation`.

    For a complete guide on using Mintlify with OpenAPI, check out [this guide](/api-playground/openapi/setup). [This guide](/api-playground/openapi/writing-openapi) explains how to configure your API authentication methods. For manual API references definition, explore [our syntax](/api-playground/overview).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="star" title="Adding a Custom Domain">

    Integrate your docs into your website by hosting them on a custom domain. This is included even in the free Mintlify plan. Navigate to your [dashboard settings](https://www.dashboard.mintlify.com/settings) to add a custom domain.
