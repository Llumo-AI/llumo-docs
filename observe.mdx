- **Response Accuracy** → Tracks the correctness and reliability of AI-generated responses. A higher accuracy indicates fewer hallucinations and better AI performance.  
- **Response Time** → Measures the latency of AI responses. Faster response times enhance user experience, especially for real-time applications like chatbots and AI assistants.  
- **User Satisfaction** → Displays positive vs. negative feedback from users interacting with the AI. A high satisfaction rate suggests effective and useful AI responses.  
- **User Engagement** → Measures how actively users interact with the AI, reflecting adoption and usability. A percentage increase shows growing engagement.  
- **Escalation Rate** → Indicates how often AI fails to resolve queries, leading to human intervention. A lower percentage is desirable. The percentage increase suggests potential performance issues.  
- **Fallback Rate** → Tracks how often the AI fails to generate a meaningful response and falls back to predefined responses. High fallback rates may indicate incomplete training or ineffective prompt engineering.  
- **Query Volume** → Monitors AI usage trends. An increased percentage suggests growing adoption or increased demand for AI interactions.  
- **User Recognition Rate** → Measures how well the AI identifies returning users or understands user queries. An improvement percentage signals better personalization and recognition.  
- **First Contact Resolution** → Measures how effectively AI resolves queries in the first interaction without requiring follow-ups. A higher FCR boosts efficiency.  
- **Intent Recognition Rate** → Evaluates how well AI understands user intent. A high rate suggests strong NLP capabilities and effective intent classification.  
- **Conversation Completion Rate** → Shows how many AI-driven conversations reach a natural resolution. A declining rate may indicate users dropping off due to poor responses.  
- **Sentiment Analysis** → Analyzes the sentiment of AI-generated responses and user feedback. Helps in identifying areas of improvement.  
- **Hallucination Rate** → Tracks how often the AI generates inaccurate or misleading responses. Lower rates indicate higher reliability. A positive trend suggests ongoing improvements.
